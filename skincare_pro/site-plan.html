        Did you know the skin is our biggest organ and plays a huge role in ensuring we stay happy and healthy? This is why it is exceptionally important to take care of your skin through daily skincare habits and a nourishing skincare routine that boosts the health of your body’s first layer of defense (aka the skin!). 
        However, instead of implementing just a basic skincare routine, here’s why you should build an advanced skincare routine. 
      </p>

        Colored paragraph example

      <p class="colored">
        Almost everyone has a skincare routine, whether it be a simple one that just involves washing the face with water or a more advanced skincare routine that includes several different types of cleansers, serums, moisturizers, facials, and more. 
        However, some skincare routines are indeed better than others. This 2019 study showed that the benefits of using a comprehensive skincare routine significantly outweigh the benefits of a simple one.
