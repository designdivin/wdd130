                        <h2>skin reflects health</h2>
                        <p>Skin can reflect the health of an individual. Take the liver for instance. The liver works to eliminate toxins from the body. When unable to do so,
                        the liver will seek another way to get rid of toxins. Here is where the skin enters the picture. If liver function is impaired,
                        the liver will push the toxins through the skin. This can be reflected in the skin as dermatitis, eczema, liver spots, rashes, and even premature wrinkles.
                        Jaundice, the yellowing of the skin, is another sign the liver is not functioning properly.
                    
                        Patches of dark skin, known as hyperpigmentation, are a potential sign of diabetes. Round lesions are often the beginning of the autoimmune disorder lupus.
                        Hives are the signal that an allergen is affecting or has entered the body. Skin not only protects the body from the outside but
                        also alerts doctors to what is occurring on the inside.</p>
                        <h2>3 layers of skin</h2>
                        <p>Because skin is the strongest and largest barrier against infection, proper skin care is essential.
                        Proper skin care will keep the outermost layer intact, maintaining enough hydration in the inner layers. Skin has 3 layers:Epidermis: the outmost layer creates skin tone and provides a waterproof barrier. Dermis: the middle layer contains sweat glands, connective tissue, hair follicles, blood vessels, and nerves. Hypodermis: the innermost and thickest layer is made mostly of fat.</p>
